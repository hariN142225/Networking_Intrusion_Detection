# Networking_Intrusion_Detection
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning, trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, and fully developed and deployed on IBM Cloud. It detects and classifies network traffic into normal and attack types (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) in real time using a deployed REST API through IBM Watson Machine Learning.

**The system includes:**

End-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing, training, evaluation

IBM Watson AutoAI for automated model selection

Deployment as an online REST API using Watson Machine Learning

Token-based authentication and scoring script for inference

Optional Streamlit-based frontend for real-time predictions

**Tech stack:**

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas

IBM Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning

IBM Cloud Object Storage

NSL-KDD dataset from Kaggle

**Use Cases:**

Cybersecurity education

Network security research

Real-time intrusion detection prototyping
