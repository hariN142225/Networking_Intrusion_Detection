# Networking_Intrusion_Detection
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning, trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, and fully developed and deployed on IBM Cloud. It detects and classifies network traffic into normal and attack types (DoS, Probe, R2L, U2R) in real time using a deployed REST API through IBM Watson Machine Learning.
